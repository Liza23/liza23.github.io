Driven by a passion for using technology to address societal challenges, I am a dedicated researcher with a focus on leveraging AI for mental health diagnostics and large-scale data analysis to inform health and social policies. My work bridges technical innovation and human impact, exploring areas such as psychological disorder identification through NLP and multimodal AI, as well as robotics applications in unstructured environments.

I have a strong interdisciplinary background, with leadership experience on high-performing teams, including the IITB Mars Rover Team, and collaborative research contributions with institutions such as Honda R&D and the University of Freiburg. My commitment to education and empowerment is reflected in my involvement in initiatives supporting children’s education and women’s health.

Beyond my research, I value organization and intentionality, whether setting up my workspace for productivity or approaching challenges with a systematic mindset. These qualities underpin my aspiration to create meaningful advancements in AI and robotics that contribute to both scientific discovery and societal well-being.
