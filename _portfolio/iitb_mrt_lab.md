title: "IITB Mars Rover Team"
excerpt: "The IITB Mars Rover Team was founded in 2012 with the goal of understanding the science and engineering behind building a rover for the red planet. The team has grown to be a platform for experimentation and production of rover prototypes, similar to how NASA has produced rovers such as the Pathfinder. The team has its own line of 6 rovers that have been upgraded to become more advanced and robust over time.<br/><img src='/images/mars_rover_team.jpg'>"
