title: "Digital Epidemiology: Social Media Analysis for Insights into Epilepsy and Mental Health"
collection: publications
category: journals
excerpt: 'Social media platforms, particularly Reddits r/Epilepsy community, offer a unique perspective into the experiences of individuals with epilepsy (PWE) and their caregivers. This study analyzes 57k posts and 533k comments to explore key themes across demographics such as age, gender, and relationships. Our findings highlight significant discussions on epilepsy-related challenges, including depression (with 39.75% of posts indicating severe symptoms), driving restrictions, workplace concerns, and pregnancy-related issues in women with epilepsy. We introduce a novel engagement metric, F(P), which incorporates post length, sentiment scores, and readability to quantify community interaction. This analysis underscores the importance of integrated care addressing both neurological and mental health challenges faced by PWE. The insights from this study inform strategies for targeted support and awareness interventions.'
