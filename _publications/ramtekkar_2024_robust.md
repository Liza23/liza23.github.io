title: "Robust Depth-Aided Segmentation for Drivable Region Detection in Challenging Environments"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a method for detecting drivable regions in challenging terrains using RGB-D data. By integrating depth information with semantic segmentation, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy across diverse landscapes. Leveraging the SegFormer architecture, we effectively distinguish drivable from non-drivable areas. Additionally, we introduce a depth-based refinement mechanism to ensure reliable performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive evaluation in both off-road and on-road environments confirms the effectiveness of our approach. Using the SA-1B dataset with grounded SAM, our method achieves precise delineation of road classes during training. Overall, this work advances autonomous navigation systems by providing a comprehensive solution for drivable region detection in complex terrains in real time, even on edge computing devices.'
